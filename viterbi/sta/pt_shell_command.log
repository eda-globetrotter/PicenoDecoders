#@ #
#@ # This is a simple sample script file for PrimeTime
#@ # Written by Ehsan Pakbaznia for EE577B Fall 2007
#@ # Use this script template as an start poit and add/modify your own commands
#@ #
#@ #############################################################################
#@ 
#@ # Reading the design
#@ # copy your synthesized verilog file in the ./designs/ before timing analysis
#@ # NOTE: you should use your own design name "sta_tut.v" is just an example
#@ read_verilog syntheziedviterbi.v ;
#@ 
#@ # Link the design with the library
#@ 
#@ link_design ;
#@ 
#@ # Create clock for your design
#@ # NOTE: you should modify this command to put the appropraite clock period
#@ # and to connect the clock to the appropriate port of your design
#@ # this example creates a clock signal named "CLK" with period of 6.666 ns
#@ # the created clock signal will be connected to the port "clk1" of your design 
#@ create_clock -period 6.666 -name CLK [get_ports clk];
#@ 
#@ # Set the clock latency
#@ # with this command you can specify the delay between the edge of the system 
#@ # clock (CLK) and the edge of the clock that gets to the sequential devices 
#@ # inside your design
#@ 
#@ set_clock_latency 2.0 CLK;
#@ 
#@ # Here you should set your input delays using the set_input_delay coammand
#@ # here is an example for a port "in1" in your design
#@ 
#@ set_input_delay 2.0 -clock CLK [get_ports in1];
#@ 
#@ 
#@ # Here you should set your output delay constraints using the set_input_delay coammand
#@ # here is an example that makes the required time for all the output ports 
#@ # in your design to be 1.0 nanoseconds before the clock edge
#@ 
#@ set_output_delay 1.0 -clock CLK [all_outputs];
#@ 
#@ # Here you can add any other command that you wish to check and report
#@ # here is just an example
