Definition of the Viterbi algorithm (maximum likelihood algorithm),
and performs a search for the minimum cost path.
Advantages of the Viterbi algorithm compared to other convolutional
techniques
Viterbi decoder consist of 3 main components:
# Branch-Metric-Unit (BMU)
# Add-Compare-Select (ACS)
# Survivor-Memory-Unit (SMU)
BMU: perform arithmetic operations using modified T-algorithm
ACS: perform arithmetic operations using radix-2 butterfly module
SMU: trace the optimum path using the modified back-trace method
	 and the decision pointer, d, that is available from the
	 output of the ACS

At the expense of a modest increase in area, the performance is
increased by 33%.
The ACS unit is the bottleneck, and its architecture needs to
be redesigned.
Solution requires the increase in the number of trellis states
to improve the performance of the decoder by increasing
throughput.
Description of the Viterbi algorithm, ACS unit, and the new
architecture
ACS is performed sequentially/serially, and forms the worst-case
bottleneck for the throughput of the Viterbi decoder.
By modifying the ACS unit from a serial architecture into a
parallel architecture, the throughput of the decoder can be
improved. This is done by making the add and comparison
operations be performed in parallel
See Figure 9 on how to connect the blocks of the Viterbi decoder
together

Why use











 Add the following line in your script file before compiling your design, and see if the assign statements in your synthesized file are removed:

set_fix_multiple_port_nets -all -buffer_constants ;

You can also add this line:

set verilogout_no_tri "true" ;

This should import the BMU to schematic level instead of functional.










 It seems as if prime time is not recognizing the gates in the OSU library. We get errors such as

Warning: Unable to resolve reference to 'OAI22X1' in 'ACS_2_DW_cmp_1'. (LNK-005)
Warning: Unable to resolve reference to 'AND2X2' in 'ACS_2_DW_cmp_1'. (LNK-005)
Warning: Unable to resolve reference to 'BUFX4' in 'ACS_2_DW_cmp_1'. (LNK-005)
Warning: Unable to resolve reference to 'INVX2' in 'ACS_2_DW_cmp_1'. (LNK-005)

also when trying to create the
clock using the command
create_clock -period 6.6666 -name CLK [get_ports clk]

we get the following error
Warning: No ports matched 'clk' (SEL-004)
Error: Nothing matched for ports (SEL-005)
Error: Nothing matched for source_list (SEL-005)

which is not the case because our input clock is entitled clk

We are not sure of what the problem could be. In our setup file the link path is correct and in our synthesized netlist our clock is entitled clock. Could anybosy help please.

Thank you
in the create_clock command the part "[get ports clock_name]", clock_name is the name of the port which is supposed to be your clock. so, if your module clock is called "clock", you have to use [get port clock].

 yeah! PT always links the first module.

To link your viterbi_decoder module, cut and paste the module at the top of the file. Then PT automatically links the viterbi_decoder module and it will work.
